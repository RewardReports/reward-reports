# Reward Reports Protocol

The Reward Reports Protocol provides a structured framework for documenting and evaluating machine learning models, specifically focused on reinforcement learning systems. A key aspect of this protocol is the organization and maintenance of Reward Reports for a model, which allows for the systematic tracking of changes and improvements over time.

## Introduction

A Reward Report for a model consists of multiple versions of reports, each associated with the date it was created. These reports serve as a comprehensive record of the model's behavior, design decisions, and evaluations. The protocol encourages these reports to be stored in the model's GitHub repository, facilitating transparency and collaboration.

## Workflow Overview

The Reward Reports Protocol follows a straightforward workflow:

1. **Create a New Reward Report**

   - When you begin working on a new model or want to document changes to an existing one, start by creating a new Reward Report. This initial report serves as the foundation for tracking the model's evolution.

2. **Versioning**

   - Each Reward Report is versioned and named based on the date it was created. This naming convention makes it easy to identify and access specific versions of reports, it is also how the Reward Reports Builder tool keeps the files organized, so make sure to follow the naming conventions and not alter the file names.

3. **Documentation**

   - In your Reward Report, document essential details about the model, including its purpose, architecture, and training data. Use the structured sections to address key areas such as Optimization Intent, Implementation, Institutional Interface, and Evaluation.

4. **Iterative Updates**

   - As you make changes to the model or encounter new insights, update the Reward Report accordingly. This iterative process allows you to capture the evolution of the model's behavior and design.

5. **GitHub Repository Integration**

   - Store your Reward Reports within the model's GitHub repository. This integration ensures that the reports are easily accessible, version-controlled, and can be collaboratively reviewed.

6. **Collaboration and Accountability**

   - Reward Reports provide a means for stakeholders, including technical and non-technical experts, to collaborate, review, and assess the model's behavior and performance. This collaborative aspect enhances transparency and accountability.

7. **Choose Your Path**

   - Depending on your expertise and requirements, you can either build Reward Reports from scratch or build upon existing versions. The protocol accommodates both technical and non-technical experts, allowing them to contribute meaningfully.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Approach**

   - Decide whether you want to create a new Reward Report from scratch or build upon existing versions. 

2. **Repository Integration**

   - Ensure that the Reward Reports are integrated into the model's GitHub repository. This can be achieved by creating a dedicated folder for reports.

3. **Documentation**

   - Start documenting the model's behavior, design decisions, and evaluations in the Reward Report. Use the structured sections to provide clarity and context.

4. **Iterate and Collaborate**

   - Continuously update the Reward Report as the model evolves. Encourage collaboration and feedback from stakeholders to enhance the quality of the reports.

## Conclusion

The Reward Reports Protocol is a valuable tool for documenting, evaluating, and collaborating on machine learning models. By following this structured approach, you can systematically track the progress of your model and ensure transparency in its development.
